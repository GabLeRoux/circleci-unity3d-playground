# CircleCI Unity3d playground

This is just a quick way for me to get a container running quickly with a desired big docker image so I can verify things.

## Why CircleCI?

I can hit a button in their UI which allows me to connect over ssh and run commands directly in the container. This turns out to be very handy for testing things! :tada: :heart:
